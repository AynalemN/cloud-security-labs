# Secure IoT Device Communication and Threat Modeling on AWS

## Objective

Simulate an IoT device communicating securely with AWS while implementing device authentication, encryption, and threat mitigation strategies.

This project leverages your IoT + Cybersecurity background and differentiates you from typical cloud security candidates.

## Architecture Overview

- Simulated IoT device (Python)

- AWS IoT Core

- TLS-secured MQTT communication

- IAM policies for device authentication

## Tools & Technologies

- AWS IoT Core

- MQTT

- TLS Certificates

- IAM

- Python

## Security Controls Implemented

- X.509 certificates per device

- Encrypted TLS communication

- IAM policy enforcement

- Device-level access isolation

⚠️ Threat Model
Threats Addressed
