# AWS IAM Security Hardening & Least Privilege Implementation #
 ## Project OvervieW

This project demonstrates the design, implementation, and validation of secure AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) following least privilege, defense in depth, and zero trust principles.

The goal is to prevent unauthorized access, reduce blast radius, and detect misconfigurations commonly exploited in cloud environments.
